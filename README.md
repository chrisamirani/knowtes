### About

If you hate being a corporate hot potato ðŸ¥” this is the project to work on. In short, the goal is to give teams the option to have central knowledge base so they do have to keep asking the same questions again and again. All knowledge should be put in one place and all questions answered in one place. You don't need to wait around and be subject to corporate hot potato anymore!
